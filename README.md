# Go Pangya Server

Just another pangya server, but this time created for the Go Language.

## ðŸ¤” Considerations

This project is an experiment and probably will not be finished.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- go 1.18
- go-migrate cli
- tmux
- docker

## ðŸ’» Environment Setup

I'm currently using WSL with Ubuntu, but it should work for any Linux distro and macOS as well. Windows is not supported and never will (not by me ðŸ˜‰).


Create a `dotenv` from template

```bash
cp ./.env-template ./.env
```

Downloads deps

```bash
make deps
```

Build everything

```bash
make build
```

## ðŸš€ Running Locally

I created a make target called `run` to quickly build and run all the servers locally. You should use it, cuz it's simpler and convenient

```bash
make run
```

> ðŸ“¢ All servers are executed inside tmux, just tap `CTRL+C` to close each server.
